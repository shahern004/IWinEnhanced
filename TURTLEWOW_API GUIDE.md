# SuperCleveRoid Macros

Enhanced macro addon for World of Warcraft 1.12.1 (Vanilla/Turtle WoW) with dynamic tooltips, conditional execution, and extended syntax.

## Requirements

| Mod | Required | Purpose |
|-----|:--------:|---------|
| [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/releases) | ✅ | Extended API (addon won't load without it) |
| [Nampower](https://gitea.com/avitasia/nampower/releases) (v2.24+) | ✅ | Spell queueing, DBC data, auto-attack events |
| [UnitXP_SP3](https://codeberg.org/konaka/UnitXP_SP3/releases) | ✅ | Distance checks, `[multiscan]` enemy scanning |

---

## Quick Start

### Basic Syntax
```lua
#showtooltip
/cast [mod:alt] Frostbolt; [mod:ctrl] Fire Blast; Blink
```

- **Conditionals** in `[]` brackets, space or comma separated
- **Arguments** use colon: `[mod:alt]`, `[hp:>50]`
- **Negation** with `no` prefix: `[nobuff]`, `[nomod:alt]`
- **Target** with `@`: `[@mouseover,help]`, `[@party1,hp:<50]`
- **Spell names** with spaces: `"Mark of the Wild"` or `Mark_of_the_Wild`

### Multi-Value Logic
```lua
[buff:X/Y]        -- X OR Y (has either)
[buff:X&Y]        -- X AND Y (has both)
[nobuff:X/Y]      -- NOT X AND NOT Y (missing both) - operators flip for negation
```

### Comparisons
```lua
[hp:>50]          -- Health above 50%
[buff:"Name"<5]   -- Less than 5 seconds remaining
[debuff:"Name">#3] -- 3+ stacks (use ># for stacks)
```

### Special Prefixes
| Prefix | Example | Description |
|:------:|---------|-------------|
| `!` | `!Attack` | Only use if not active |
| `?` | `?[equipped:Swords] Ability` | Hide from tooltip |
| `~` | `~Slow Fall` | Toggle buff on/off |

---

## Conditionals Reference

All conditionals support negation with `no` prefix (e.g., `[nocombat]`, `[nobuff]`, `[nohelp]`). Some also have semantic opposites: `help`/`harm`, `isplayer`/`isnpc`, `alive`/`dead`, `inrange`/`outrange`.

### pfUI Tank Integration

Identify loose mobs in trash pulls by checking if enemies are targeting designated tanks. Works with pfUI's tank marking systems.

**Tank Conditionals:**
| Conditional | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `[targeting:tank]` | Target IS attacking any player marked as tank |
| `[notargeting:tank]` | Target is NOT attacking any tank (loose mob!) |
| `[istank]` | Target unit IS marked as tank |
| `[noistank]` | Target unit is NOT marked as tank |

**Setting Up Tanks in pfUI:**

1. **Nameplate Off-Tank Names** (recommended): `/pfui` → Nameplates → Off-Tank Names
   - Add tank names separated by `#`: `#TankName1#TankName2#TankName3`
   - These names will show different colored nameplates AND work with `[targeting:tank]`

2. **Raid Frame Toggle**: Right-click a player in raid frames → "Toggle as Tank"
   - Only works when raid frames are visible

**Example Macros:**
```lua
-- Pick up loose mobs (not targeting any tank)
/cast [multiscan:nearest,notargeting:tank,harm] Taunt

-- Only taunt if mob is targeting you (tank)
/cast [targeting:player] Sunder Armor

-- Assist tanks - attack what they're tanking
/cast [multiscan:nearest,targeting:tank,harm] Sunder Armor

-- Emergency taunt on loose mob hitting a healer
/cast [notargeting:tank,notargeting:player] Taunt
```

**Debug Command:**
```
/cleveroid tankdebug
```
Shows all marked tanks, current target info, and conditional results.

#### Priority-Based Macro Evaluation (`/firstaction` & `/nofirstaction`)

By default, all `/cast` lines in a macro are evaluated and may queue spells with Nampower. Use `/firstaction` to enable "first successful cast wins" behavior - once a `/cast` or `/use` succeeds, the macro stops evaluating subsequent lines. Use `/nofirstaction` to re-enable normal multi-queue behavior.

```lua
-- WITHOUT /firstaction: Both Shred AND Claw may queue if conditions are met
/cast [myrawpower:>48] Shred
/cast [myrawpower:>40] Claw

-- WITH /firstaction: Only Shred casts if energy >= 48, Claw is skipped
/firstaction
/cast [myrawpower:>48] Shred
/cast [myrawpower:>40] Claw

-- Mixed mode: priority section + always-queue section
/firstaction
/cast [myrawpower:>48] Shred      -- Priority: only one of these
/cast [myrawpower:>40] Claw
/nofirstaction
/cast Tiger's Fury                -- Always evaluates (can queue alongside)
/startattack

-- With conditionals
/firstaction [group]              -- Priority mode only in groups
/cast [myrawpower:>48] Shred
/cast [myrawpower:>40] Claw
```

**Child Macro Behavior:** `/firstaction` and `/nofirstaction` in child macros (called via `{MacroName}`) affect subsequent lines in the parent macro. Think of the child's lines as being "inlined" at the call site.

**Comparison:**
- `/stopmacro [cond]` - Stop if condition is true (regardless of cast success)
- `/skipmacro [cond]` - Stop current submacro only
- `/firstaction [cond]` - Stop on first **successful** cast/use (priority mode)
- `/nofirstaction [cond]` - Re-enable multi-queue behavior after `/firstaction`

### Commands without Conditional Support

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/retarget` | Clear invalid target, target nearest enemy |
| `/runmacro Name` | Execute macro by name (use `{MacroName}` in `/cast` for conditionals) |
| `/rl` | Reload UI |

### UnitXP 3D Enemy Scanning

`/target` with any conditionals automatically uses UnitXP 3D scanning to find enemies in line of sight, even without nameplates visible. The only exception is `[help]` without `[harm]` (friendly-only targeting).

```lua
/target [name:Onyxia]           -- Scans for exact name match
/target [nodead,harm]           -- Scans for living enemies
/target [hp:<30]                -- Scans for low HP enemies
/target [cc:stun]               -- Scans for stunned enemies

-- Kara 40 Mage Incantagos example --
/target [name:Red_Affinity]
/cast [name:Red_Affinity] Fireball
/target [name:Blue_Affinity]
/cast [name:Blue_Affinity] Frostbolt
/target [name:Mana_Affinity]
/cast [name:Mana_Affinity] Arcane Missiles
```

If no matching target is found, your original target is preserved.

## Features

### Debuff Timer System
Auto-learns debuff durations from your casts. 335+ spells pre-configured.
```lua
/cast [nodebuff:Moonfire] Moonfire   -- Apply if missing
/cast [debuff:Moonfire<4] Moonfire   -- Refresh if < 4 sec left
/cast Wrath                          -- Filler
```

### Combo Point Tracking
Tracks finisher durations (Rip, Rupture, Kidney Shot) accounting for combo points spent.

### Talent & Equipment Modifiers
Automatically adjusts tracked durations for talents (Imp. Gouge, Taste for Blood, etc.) and equipment (Idol of Savagery).

### Special Mechanics (TWoW)
- **Carnage** (Druid): Detects Rip/Rake refresh from Ferocious Bite proc
- **Molten Blast** (Shaman): Flame Shock refresh detection
- **Conflagrate** (Warlock): Immolate reduction tracking
- **Dark Harvest** (Warlock): DoT acceleration compensation

## Immunity Tracking Guide

The addon auto-learns NPC immunities from combat. When a spell fails with "immune", the addon remembers it for that NPC.

### Using `[noimmune]`

| Usage | What it checks |
|-------|----------------|
| `[noimmune]` | Auto-detects spell's school from action |
| `[noimmune:fire]` | Fire immunity specifically |
| `[noimmune:bleed]` | Bleed immunity specifically |
| `[noimmune:stun]` | Stun CC immunity |

### Common Examples

```lua
-- Fire Mage: Skip immune targets
/cast [noimmune] Fireball

-- Warlock: Check shadow immunity
/cast [noimmune:shadow] Corruption

-- Rogue: Skip stun-immune targets
/cast [noimmune:stun] Cheap Shot
/cast Sinister Strike

-- Druid: Check fear immunity for Hibernate
/cast [noimmune:sleep,type:Beast/Dragonkin] Hibernate
```

### Split Damage Spells (Rake, Pounce, Garrote)

These spells have an initial physical hit + a bleed DoT. The addon **automatically checks BOTH immunities**:

```lua
-- Checks both physical AND bleed immunity
/cast [noimmune] Rake

-- With time check using Cursive
/cast [noimmune, cursive:Rake<1.5] Rake

-- Multi-DoT rotation
/cast [noimmune, nocursive:Rake] Rake
/cast [noimmune, nocursive:Rip, combo:>=4] Rip
```

`[noimmune]` for these spells returns false (skip cast) if target is immune to **either** component. You can also check specific schools:
- `[noimmune:physical]` - only checks physical immunity
- `[noimmune:bleed]` - only checks bleed immunity

### Pure Bleed Spells (Rip, Rupture, Rend)

These are pure bleeds with no initial hit:

```lua
-- Rip (pure bleed)
/cast [noimmune, combo:>=4] Rip

-- Rupture (pure bleed)
/cast [noimmune, combo:>=4] Rupture
```

### Manually Adding Immunities

If you know an NPC is immune before fighting:
```lua
/cleveroid addimmune "Boss Name" bleed        -- Permanent bleed immunity
/cleveroid addimmune "Boss Name" fire "Shield" -- Fire immune only when buffed
/cleveroid addccimmune "Boss Name" stun       -- Permanent stun immunity
```

### Viewing Learned Immunities

```lua
/cleveroid listimmune           -- All school immunities
/cleveroid listimmune bleed     -- Only bleed immunities
/cleveroid listccimmune         -- All CC immunities
/cleveroid listccimmune stun    -- Only stun immunities
```

---

## Debuff Tracking Guide

### Built-in Tracking (`[debuff]`)

The addon checks debuffs on the target:

```lua
-- Basic: Only cast if target doesn't have Moonfire
/cast [nodebuff:Moonfire] Moonfire

-- Time check: Refresh when < 4 seconds left
/cast [debuff:Moonfire<4] Moonfire
```

**Notes:**
- Existence checks (`[nodebuff]`, `[debuff]`) detect ANY debuff on target
- Time-remaining checks (`[debuff:X<5]`) use internal tracking from your casts
- Shared debuffs (Sunder, Faerie Fire) are detected from any source

### Cursive Integration (`[cursive]`)

[Cursive](https://github.com/avitasia/Cursive) provides more accurate GUID-based tracking:

```lua
-- Check if target has Rake (any time remaining)
/cast [nocursive:Rake] Rake

-- Refresh when < 3 seconds remaining
/cast [cursive:Rake<3] Rake

-- Complex: Only if missing OR about to expire
/cast [nocursive:Rake>1.5] Rake
```

**Advantages of Cursive:**
- GUID-based (survives target switching)
- Tracks pending casts
- Works at debuff cap
- More accurate timing

### MonkeySpeed Integration (`[moving]`)

[MonkeySpeed](https://github.com/jrc13245/MonkeySpeed) provides accurate movement speed detection via SuperWoW's `UnitPosition` API:

```lua
-- Only cast if standing still
/cast [nomoving] Aimed Shot

-- Cast instant ability while moving
/cast [moving] Arcane Shot

-- Check speed percentage (100 = normal run speed)
/cast [moving:>100] Sprint    -- Already faster than normal
/cast [moving:<50] Escape Artist  -- Currently slowed

-- Combined with other conditionals
/cast [nomoving, harm] Aimed Shot
/cast [moving, harm] Arcane Shot
```

**Speed Reference:**
| Speed | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `0` | Standing still |
| `100` | Normal run speed |
| `160` | Level 40 mount |
| `200` | Epic mount |

**Notes:**
- Basic `[moving]`/`[nomoving]` works without MonkeySpeed (position fallback)
- Speed comparisons (`[moving:>100]`) require MonkeySpeed addon
- Speed values vary with buffs/debuffs affecting movement

### Recommended DoT Macro Patterns

**Druid Feral (with Cursive):**
```lua
#showtooltip
/cast [noimmune, nocursive:Rake] Rake
```

**Druid Feral (without Cursive):**
```lua
#showtooltip
/cast [noimmune, nodebuff] Rake
```

**Warlock Multi-DoT:**
```lua
#showtooltip
/cast [noimmune:shadow, nodebuff] Corruption
```

**Rogue Rupture:**
```lua
#showtooltip
/cast [noimmune, nodebuff, combo:>=4] Rupture
```

# UnitXP_SP3 Lua functions

## Line of sight

```lua
local bool_abc = UnitXP("inSight", UNIT_ID_1, UNIT_ID_2);
```

This would return TRUE if UNIT_ID_1 is in sight of UNIT_ID_2.

## Distance

```lua
local double_abc = UnitXP("distanceBetween", UNIT_ID_1, UNIT_ID_2);
```

This would return the distance between `UNIT_ID_1` and `UNIT_ID_2`. The default meter is accurate for ranged spell like bolts or heals.

```lua
local double_abc = UnitXP("distanceBetween", UNIT_ID_1, UNIT_ID_2, "AoE");
```

The `AoE` meter is accurate for novas.

```lua
local double_abc = UnitXP("distanceBetween", UNIT_ID_1, UNIT_ID_2, "meleeAutoAttack");
```

The `meleeAutoAttack` meter is accurate for melee weapon swings. Beware that melee spell cast is not the same as melee weapon swings: Taunt has a different range than auto-attack.

## Behind

```lua
local bool_abc = UnitXP("behind", UNIT_ID_1, UNIT_ID_2);
```

This would return TRUE if `UNIT_ID_1` is behind `UNIT_ID_2`.

There are some strange mobs whose back is not the π radian half of its back. You could set the range smaller by:

 ```lua
 local back = UnitXP("behindThreshold", "set", 2);
 ```

The third parameter by default is π/2 and it ranges from 0 to π the bigger of it, the smaller radian range would be judged as back.

## Timer

```lua
local timer_id = UnitXP("timer", "arm", 1000, 2000, callback_function_name);
```

Arm a new timer which would trigger after 1000 milliseconds and would repeat every 2000 milliseconds to execute callback_function_name. You could pass 0 to stop repeating.

The timer ID would be passed into callback function as 1st parameter.

The xp3 timers run in a different thread from the game so that they would not cost game time to maintain. And they would trigger only when the time comes, rather than every frame.

```lua
UnitXP("timer", "disarm", TIMER_ID);
```

As xp3 timers are in a different thread, they would not be stopped when the game reload. Addon author needs to react to `PLAYER_LOGOUT` event and disarm running timers.

```lua
local total = UnitXP("timer", "size");
```

Return total count of running timers.

## OS notifications

```lua
UnitXP("notify", "taskbarIcon");

UnitXP("notify", "systemSound");
```

Trigger a taskbar icon flash or a sound alert in operating system. These functions only effective when the game is in background.

## Advanced Lua debugger

The xp3 provides a step by step debugger for in-game Lua. The debugger program is in UnitXP_SP3-debug packages.

### To use the debugger

1. Run `Demo Lua Debugger.exe`. It is a C# program which would work on Windows (via .NET framework) and Linux (via Mono).
2. In the Lua code, add a breakpoint as `UnitXP("debug", "breakpoint");`
3. Start the game and run the Lua code.

The xp3 would connect to debugger via TCP port 2323. Lua source preview requires `Demo Lua Debugger`.exe being placed in game's folder.

## Version and existence

To tell if xp3 is exist in the game:

```lua
local xp3 = pcall(UnitXP, "nop", "nop");
```

Returns TRUE for existing.

```lua
local xp3exist, xp3buildTime = pcall(UnitXP, "version", "coffTimeDateStamp");
```

`xp3buildTime` is the time when xp3 is compiled and built. It is a UNIX timestamp so that you could compare as number to tell which one is newer.

```lua
local xp3exist, xp3info = pcall(UnitXP, "version", "additionalInformation");
```

`xp3info` is a string contains some description about the version. It meant to be used by different xp3 maintainer to distinguish bloodline.

## Performance profile

```lua
local performance = UnitXP("performanceProfile", "get");
```

performance would be a string that shows performance factors of xp3.

## Targeting

These functions could be bound to keys via in-game Key Bindings menu. Also they could be called via Lua.

Most targeting functions follow rules:

- When there is no selected target, select the nearest enemy.
- Select enemies in line of sight of player character.
- Select enemies in front of camera. It is possbile to narrow the targeting cone to be smaller than camera sight by `UnitXP("target", "rangeCone", 2.5);` The third parameter ranges from `2.0 to infinate`, the bigger of it, the narrower targeting cone.
- The farthest range (farRange) by default is 41, which could be adjusted in range `26 to 60` by `UnitXP("target", "farRange", 60);`.
- When the player is in-combat, only select enemies who is in-combat either. This limitation could be lifted by `UnitXP("target", "disableInCombatFilter");`.
- Totems, Pets and Critters would be ignored.
- Targeting functions return TRUE when they found a target, so that you could chain multiple functions.

```lua
local found = UnitXP("target", "nearestEnemy");
```
Target the nearest enemy. It is the only one, no cycling.

```lua
local found = UnitXP("target", "mostHP");
```

Target the enemy with most HP. It is the only one, no cycling.

```lua
local found = UnitXP("target", "worldBoss");
```

Cycling around world bosses.

```lua
local found = UnitXP("target", "nextEnemyInCycle");

local found = UnitXP("target", "previousEnemyInCycle");
```

Cycling around enemies. It is gurandteed that when repeatly trigger this function, all enemies in range would be selected for once.

Ranged class might prefer this function as TAB key.

```lua
local found = UnitXP("target", "nextEnemyConsideringDistance");

local found = UnitXP("target", "previousEnemyConsideringDistance");
```

Cycling around enemies. Enemies are classified into 3 range buckets `0 to 8`, `8 to 25`, `25 to farRange`. This function would give priority to enemies in the near bucket, so that when there is a targetable enemy in near bucket, the rest is ignored.

In `0 to 8` range the function cycling around all in-range enemies.

In `8 to 25` range the function cycling around 3 nearest in-range enemies.

In `25 to farRange` range the function cycling around 5 nearest in-range enemies.

```lua
local found = UnitXP("target", "nextMarkedEnemyInCycle");

local found = UnitXP("target", "previousMarkedEnemyInCycle");
```

Cycling around raid marked enemies. By default the order is:

- White Skull
- Red Cross (X)
- Blue Square
- White Moon
- Green Triangle
- Purple Diamond
- Orange Circle
- Yellow Star

You could supply a third parameter to reorder or limit to specific marks:

```lua
local found = UnitXP("target", "nextMarkedEnemyInCycle", "138"); would cycle in order:
```

- Yellow Star which is index 1
- Purple Diamond which is index 3
- White Skull which is index 8

# SuperWOW Lua Features

## Existing Function Changes

- CastSpellByName function now can take unit as 2nd argument in addition to true/false OnSelf flag
- UnitExists now also returns GUID of unit
- UnitDebuff and UnitBuff now additionally return the id of the aura
-Using UnitMana("player") as a druid now always returns your current form power and caster form mana at the same time.
- frame:GetName(1) can now be used on nameplate frames to return the GUID of the attached unit.
- SetRaidTarget now accepts 3rd argument "local" flag to assign a mark to your own client. This allows using target markers while solo.
- LootSlot(slotid) that was previously used only to confirm "are you sure you want to loot this item" now has the usage format LootSlot(slotid [, forceloot]). LootSlot(slotid, 1) can now be used to actually loot a slot.
- GetContainerItemInfo now returns item's charges instead of stacks if the item is not stackable & has charges. Charges are given as a negative number.
- GetWeaponEnchantInfo() now can accept a friendly player (ex: party1) as argument. If used in this way, it gives the name of the temporary enchant on that player's mainhand & offhand. Old functionality is preserved for own player's enchant duration & stacks.
- Macros can now be treated by the game as an item or a spell action by starting the macro with: "/tooltip spell:spellid" or "/tooltip item:itemid" respectively.
- GetActionCount, GetActionCooldown, and ActionIsConsumable now work for macros returning the result of the linked spell or item. For example, you can create a macro that starts with "/tooltip item:18641" and all of these functions will treat it as if it's the item 18641 (dense dynamite), even if the macro will cast a different action on press.
- GetActionText(actionButton) now additionally returns action type ("MACRO", "ITEM", "SPELL") and its id, or for macro, its index. a macro's index is the value used by GetMacroInfo(index). This allows you to differentiate between two macros on your actionbar that have the same name, or to find the id of an item or spell that is on your bar.

## New Functions

- GetPlayerBuffID(buffindex) function that returns id of the aura.
- CombatLogAdd("text"[, addToRawLog]) function that prints a message directly to the combatlog file. If flag is set, prints the message to the raw combatlog file instead.
- SpellInfo(spellid) function that returns information about a spell id (name, rank, texture file, minrange, max range to target).
- TrackUnit(unitid) function that adds a friendly unit to the minimap.
- UnitPosition(unitid) function that returns coordinates of a friendly unit.
- SetMouseoverUnit(unitid) function that sets as current hovered unit. Usage for unitframe addon makers: do SetMouseoverUnit(frameUnit) on enter, and SetMouseoverUnit() on leave to clear. This allows "mouseover" of other functions to work on that currently hovered frame's unit.
- Clickthrough(0/1) to turn off/on Clickthrough mode, Clickthrough() to simply return whether it's on. Clickthrough mode allows you to click through creature corpses that have no loot, to loot the creatures that are under them & covered by them.
- SetAutoloot(0/1) to turn off/on autoloot, SetAutoloot() to simply return whether it's on. The hardcoded activation of autoloot by holding shift has been removed. You now turn it on or off through this function).
- ImportFile("filename") reads a txt file in gamedirectory\imports and returns a string of its contents.
- ExportFile("filename", "text") creates a txt file in gamedirectory\imports and writes text in it.
- all functions that accept a unit as argument ("player", "target", "mouseover") now can accept an additional suffix "owner" which returns the owner of the unit (example, if you target a totem and do UnitName("targetowner") you'll get the name of the shaman).
- all functions taht accept a unit as argument ("player, "target", "mouseover") now can accept "mark1" to "mark8" as argument which returns the unit with the corresponding marker index.
- all functions that accept a unit as argument ("player", "target", "mouseover") now can accept the GUID of the unit, which can be obtained from UnitExists or GetName(1) on its nameplate. Suffixes can still be appended at the end of that string.
- Global variables SUPERWOW_STRING and SUPERWOW_VERSION give mod info for addons.
